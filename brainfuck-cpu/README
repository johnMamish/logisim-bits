brainfuck.circ contains a CPU which runs brainfuck as its native language.

Output is provided via a simulated terminal in the top right corner, and input 
can be typed into the small bar below. These are accessed via the '.' and ',' 
brainfuck instructions.

The default program loaded outputs fibonacci numbers in the terminal. To run 
it, use the "normal" logisim commands: press <Ctrl+R> to reset the simulation
and <Ctrl+K> to enable clock ticks. I suggest running the CPU above 256 Hz to 
see anything happen.

To load a different program, left click the ROM labeled "PROGRAM MEMORY", and
select "(click to edit)" in the lower left context menu. In the hex editing 
window that opens, select the "Open..." open at the bottom left, and choose a
.bfasm program from the /test-programs folder.
The .bfasm files are nothing more than regular brainfuck programs imported into
logisim's custom hex format.
